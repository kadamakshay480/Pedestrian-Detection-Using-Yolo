# Pedestrian-Detection-Using-Yolo

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of images or videos containing pedestrians. This dataset should include a variety of pedestrian poses, backgrounds, lighting conditions, and occlusions.

Annotation: Annotate the dataset by marking bounding boxes around pedestrians in each image or frame of the video. This annotation process provides ground truth labels for training the model.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the annotated dataset, which may involve resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting data to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve model generalization.

Model Selection: Choose YOLO as the object detection algorithm for pedestrian detection. YOLO is preferred for its real-time performance and ability to detect multiple objects in a single pass through the neural network.

Training: Train the YOLO model on the annotated dataset using techniques like transfer learning. Transfer learning involves initializing the model with weights pretrained on a large dataset (e.g., COCO dataset) and fine-tuning it on the pedestrian detection dataset.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained YOLO model on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance in terms of metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). Adjust model hyperparameters if necessary to improve performance.

Deployment: Deploy the trained YOLO model for pedestrian detection in real-world applications. This may involve integrating the model into software systems, surveillance cameras, or autonomous vehicles to detect pedestrians in images or videos in real-time.
